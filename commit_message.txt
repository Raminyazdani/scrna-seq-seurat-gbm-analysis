Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(norm): Add SCTransform normalization

Implemented data normalization using SCTransform method:
- Added SCTransform normalization code
- Configured glmGamPoi backend for improved performance
- Set variance stabilization parameters

BUG INTRODUCED: Failed to add install_if_missing() calls for sctransform and glmGamPoi packages before using them. This breaks the established pattern and will cause errors on fresh installations.

Status: BROKEN - Will require hotfix in next step.
