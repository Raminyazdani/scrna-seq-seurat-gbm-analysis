Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(qc): Create Seurat object

Created the primary Seurat object for analysis:
- Initialized with expression counts matrix
- Set project name for tracking
- Object now contains cells (columns) and genes (rows)

The Seurat object is the central data structure that will hold all downstream analysis results including QC metrics, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.

Verification: Object creation succeeds, contains expected number of cells and genes.
