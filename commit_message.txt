Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(qc): Calculate quality control metrics

Implemented comprehensive QC metric calculation:
- percent.mt: Mitochondrial gene expression percentage (cell stress indicator)
- percent.ribo: Ribosomal gene expression percentage
- nCount_RNA: Total UMI counts per cell (automatically calculated)
- nFeature_RNA: Number of unique genes detected per cell (automatically calculated)

These metrics help identify low-quality cells: high mitochondrial content suggests dying cells, low UMI/gene counts indicate poor capture efficiency or empty droplets.

Verification: All metrics calculated successfully, value ranges are biologically plausible.
