Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(qc): Add QC visualization and IQR filtering

Implemented QC visualization and statistical filtering:
- Created violin plots showing distribution of all QC metrics
- Applied IQR (Interquartile Range) method for outlier detection
- Filtered cells with extreme nFeature_RNA values (too high or too low)

IQR filtering removes statistical outliers: Q1 - 1.5×IQR for lower bound, Q3 + 1.5×IQR for upper bound. This is robust to non-normal distributions common in scRNA-seq data.

Verification: Visualizations show clear distribution patterns, filtering removes appropriate outliers while preserving main population.
