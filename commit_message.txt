Determined number of PCs to use for downstream analysis:
- Generated elbow plot showing variance explained by each PC
- Identified elbow point where variance levels off
- Selected 30 PCs based on visual inspection

The elbow plot helps balance capturing biological variation (more PCs) against noise reduction (fewer PCs). The elbow point represents diminishing returns where additional PCs add more noise than signal.

Verification: Elbow plot shows clear leveling around PC 30, selected PC count is appropriate.
