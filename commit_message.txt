Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | feat(data): HOTFIX - Add file existence checks

Fixed data loading bug from step 06:
- Added check for data/ directory existence, create if missing
- Added file.exists() check before attempting to read
- Provide clear error message if expression file not found
- Document requirement to download data file

The bug was discovered when testing on a fresh checkout - the script crashed with a cryptic "file not found" error. Now provides clear guidance to users.

Lesson learned: Always check file/directory existence before I/O operations, especially for external data dependencies.

Verification: Script now handles missing data gracefully with informative error message, creates data/ directory automatically.
