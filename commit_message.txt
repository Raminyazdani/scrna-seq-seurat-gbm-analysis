Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(setup): Create package installation helper

Created the install_if_missing() helper function to manage automatic package installation:
- Supports both CRAN and Bioconductor sources
- Checks if package is already installed before attempting installation
- Automatically installs BiocManager when needed for Bioconductor packages
- Returns silently if package is already available

This helper will be used throughout the pipeline to ensure all dependencies are met without manual intervention. Makes the pipeline more portable and user-friendly.

Verification: Function definition is syntactically correct, ready to be used for package management.
