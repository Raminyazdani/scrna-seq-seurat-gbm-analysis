Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(enrichment): Add KEGG and enrichment visualization

Extended pathway enrichment analysis:
- Added enrichplot for visualization
- Performed KEGG pathway enrichment
- Created dotplots showing top enriched terms

KEGG provides curated pathway information complementary to GO. Multiple databases increase confidence in biological interpretations.

Verification: KEGG enrichment identifies relevant pathways, visualizations clearly show results.
