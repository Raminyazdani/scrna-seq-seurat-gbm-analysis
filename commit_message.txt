Loaded reference data for cell type annotation:
- Added SingleR package for automated annotation
- Added celldex package for reference datasets
- Downloaded Human Primary Cell Atlas reference

The reference atlas contains known expression profiles for various human cell types. SingleR will compare cluster profiles against this reference to predict cell type identities.

Verification: Reference data downloads successfully, contains expected cell types.
