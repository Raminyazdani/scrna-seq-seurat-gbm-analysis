Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(portfolio): Add comprehensive script documentation

Added detailed file header documentation to R scripts:
- Project.R: 34-line header describing purpose, inputs, outputs, usage
- exploratory_analysis.R: 28-line header with similar documentation
- Clear usage instructions for both RStudio and command-line

Professional documentation makes the code more accessible and demonstrates good software engineering practices.

Verification: Script headers added, documentation is clear and comprehensive.
