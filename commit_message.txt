Added Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) filtering:
- Calculated median and MAD for mitochondrial percentage
- Set threshold at median + 3×MAD
- Filtered cells exceeding mitochondrial content threshold

MAD is more robust than standard deviation for outlier detection, especially with skewed distributions. High mitochondrial content typically indicates stressed or dying cells that should be removed.

Verification: Filtering removes high-mitochondrial cells while preserving healthy cell population, MAD threshold is biologically appropriate.
