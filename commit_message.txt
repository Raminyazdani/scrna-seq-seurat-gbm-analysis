Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | feat(norm): HOTFIX - Add missing normalization dependencies

Fixed critical bug from step 08 - missing package installations:
- Added install_if_missing("sctransform", "CRAN")
- Added install_if_missing("glmGamPoi", "Bioconductor")
- Placed installations before library() calls
- Restored consistency with established package management pattern

SCTransform normalization now works reliably on fresh R installations. The bug was discovered during testing on a clean environment when the script crashed with "package not found" errors.

Lesson learned: Must maintain consistency with install_if_missing() pattern for all packages. Breaking this pattern causes deployment issues.

Verification: Tested on fresh R installation, normalization runs successfully, no package loading errors.
