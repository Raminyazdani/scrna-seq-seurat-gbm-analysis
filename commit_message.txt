Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(annotation): Perform automated cell type annotation

Performed reference-based cell type annotation:
- Converted Seurat object to SingleCellExperiment for compatibility
- Ran SingleR comparing clusters against reference atlas
- Assigned predicted cell type labels to each cell
- Added annotations to Seurat object metadata

SingleR uses correlation-based matching between cluster expression profiles and reference cell types, providing automated biological interpretation of computational clusters.

Verification: Annotation completes successfully, predicted cell types are biologically plausible.
