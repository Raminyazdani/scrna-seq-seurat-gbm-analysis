Added doublet detection to remove technical artifacts:
- Integrated scDblFinder algorithm for computational doublet detection
- Converted Seurat object to SingleCellExperiment format for compatibility
- Identified and marked doublet cells
- Removed doublets from the dataset
- Generated visualizations showing doublet scores and classifications

Doublets (two cells captured as one) are common technical artifacts in droplet-based scRNA-seq. Removing them prevents spurious "intermediate" cell types in downstream clustering.

Verification: Confirmed doublet detection runs successfully, reasonable doublet rate (~5-10%), visualization shows clear separation between singlets and doublets.
