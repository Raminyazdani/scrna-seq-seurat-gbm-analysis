Extended package management to support Bioconductor packages:
- Enhanced install_if_missing() to handle both CRAN and Bioconductor sources
- Added BiocManager installation as prerequisite
- Included GEOquery for GEO data downloads
- Included SingleCellExperiment and scDblFinder for scRNA-seq analysis

This maintains the established pattern of automatic dependency installation while expanding to the Bioconductor ecosystem essential for single-cell analysis.

Verification: Confirmed BiocManager installs correctly, Bioconductor packages download and install successfully.
