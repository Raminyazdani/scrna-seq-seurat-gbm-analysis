Created correlation scatter plots for QC metrics:
- nCount_RNA vs nFeature_RNA: Shows expected positive correlation
- nCount_RNA vs percent.mt: Helps identify mitochondrial contamination patterns

These plots reveal relationships between metrics and help validate filtering decisions. High-quality cells show strong nCount/nFeature correlation with low mitochondrial content.

Verification: Scatter plots show expected patterns, filtered dataset contains high-quality cells.
