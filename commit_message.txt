Created cell type composition visualizations:
- UMAP plot colored by predicted cell types
- Shows spatial distribution of different cell types
- Reveals cellular heterogeneity in the dataset

Visualization confirms annotation quality - similar cell types should cluster together. Clear separation indicates successful annotation; mixed clusters may indicate ambiguous cell states.

Verification: Cell type visualization shows clear patterns, annotated types match expected biology.
