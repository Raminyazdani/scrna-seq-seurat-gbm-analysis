Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(de): Filter and rank marker genes

Filtered and ranked marker genes:
- Applied significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.05)
- Selected top 10 markers per cluster by fold-change
- Created ranked lists for biological interpretation

Focusing on top markers helps identify the most characteristic genes for each cell population, which can be validated against known biology or used for downstream analysis.

Verification: Top markers show strong fold-changes, include known cell type-specific genes.
