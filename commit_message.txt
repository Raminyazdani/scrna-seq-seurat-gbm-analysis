Implemented Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis:
- Added clusterProfiler for pathway analysis
- Added org.Hs.eg.db for human gene annotations
- Performed GO enrichment on marker genes
- Focused on Biological Process (BP) ontology

GO enrichment identifies biological processes and molecular functions over-represented in marker genes, providing functional interpretation of cell populations beyond just gene lists.

Verification: Enrichment analysis completes successfully, identifies biologically relevant GO terms.
