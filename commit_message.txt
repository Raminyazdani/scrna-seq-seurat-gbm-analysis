Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(data): Download GEO dataset

Implemented GEO data download functionality:
- Added GEOquery package for accessing Gene Expression Omnibus
- Configured download for GSE75688 (breast cancer scRNA-seq dataset)
- Stored GEO series object for metadata access

This establishes the data acquisition pipeline. The dataset will be cached locally for future runs, avoiding repeated downloads.

Verification: GEO download succeeds, dataset object created successfully.
