Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | feat(cluster): HOTFIX - Fix resolution parameter typo

Fixed critical clustering bug from step 11:
- Corrected parameter typo: 'resoltuion' → 'resolution'
- Verified proper parameterization with resolution=0.5
- Tested cluster formation with correct parameters
- Confirmed expected cluster counts now achieved

The typo was discovered when reviewing cluster counts that didn't match expectations. Code review revealed the misspelled parameter name, which either threw an error or was silently ignored by Seurat.

Lesson learned: Parameter typos can cause silent failures. Always verify parameter names against documentation.

Verification: Clustering now produces expected number of clusters, resolution parameter properly controls granularity.
