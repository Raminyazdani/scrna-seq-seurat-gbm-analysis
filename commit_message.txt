Performed differential expression analysis:
- Used FindAllMarkers to identify cluster-specific genes
- Tested only positive markers (upregulated in each cluster)
- Applied min.pct threshold (gene expressed in ≥25% of cells)
- Calculated log fold-changes and adjusted p-values

Identifies genes that distinguish each cluster from all others, providing molecular signatures for cell populations.

Verification: DE testing completes successfully, identifies hundreds of significant marker genes.
