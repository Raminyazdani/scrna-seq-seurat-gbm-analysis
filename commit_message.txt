Ramin Yazdani | scrna-seq-seurat-gbm-analysis | main | WIP(packages): Install core analysis packages

Added installation and loading of core packages:
- Seurat: Primary toolkit for single-cell analysis
- dplyr: Data manipulation and transformation
- ggplot2: Publication-quality visualization

Using the install_if_missing() helper ensures these packages are automatically installed if not present. These form the foundation for all downstream single-cell analysis operations.

Verification: Packages install correctly on fresh R session, library loading succeeds without errors.
