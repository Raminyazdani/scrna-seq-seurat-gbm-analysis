Performed PCA dimensionality reduction:
- Computed principal components using variable features from SCTransform
- Calculated loadings showing gene contributions to each PC
- Generated PC embeddings for all cells

PCA reduces ~20,000 genes to a smaller number of principal components that capture the main axes of variation. This reduces noise and computational burden for downstream clustering.

Verification: PCA runs successfully, PC embeddings calculated for all cells.
