Added non-linear dimensionality reduction visualizations:
- Implemented UMAP reduction for visualization
- Implemented t-SNE reduction as alternative view
- Created cluster visualizations on both embeddings
- Began parameter optimization exploration

UMAP and t-SNE provide 2D visualizations of high-dimensional data, revealing cell relationships and cluster structure. However, still affected by resolution parameter bug from step 11.

Verification: UMAP and t-SNE run successfully, visualizations generated, but cluster counts don't match expectations due to parameter bug.
